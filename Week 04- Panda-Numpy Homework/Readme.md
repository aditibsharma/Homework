Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines,
you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company.
You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most
recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are
encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing
experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a
report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful
insights.

Your final report should include each of the following:

**Player Count**

-   Total Number of Players

**Purchasing Analysis (Total)**

-   Number of Unique Items

-   Average Purchase Price

-   Total Number of Purchases

-   Total Revenue

**Gender Demographics**

-   Percentage and Count of Male Players

-   Percentage and Count of Female Players

-   Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

**Purchasing Analysis (Gender)**

-   The below each broken by gender

    -   Purchase Count

    -   Average Purchase Price

    -   Total Purchase Value

    -   Normalized Totals

**Age Demographics**

-   The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. &lt;10, 10-14,
    15-19, etc.)

    -   Purchase Count

    -   Average Purchase Price

    -   Total Purchase Value

    -   Normalized Totals

**Top Spenders**

-   Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value,
    then list (in a table):

    -   SN

    -   Purchase Count

    -   Average Purchase Price

    -   Total Purchase Value

**Most Popular Items**

-   Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a
    table):

    -   Item ID

    -   Item Name

    -   Purchase Count

    -   Item Price

    -   Total Purchase Value

**Most Profitable Items**

-   Identify the 5 most profitable items by total purchase value, then
    list (in a table):

    -   Item ID

    -   Item Name

    -   Purchase Count

    -   Item Price

    -   Total Purchase Value

As final considerations:

-   Your script must work for both data-sets given.

-   You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.

-   You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable
    Data Frames.

-   You must include an exported markdown version of your Notebook
    called README.md in your GitHub repository.

-   You must include a written description of three observable trends
    based on the data.

-   See [Example
    Solution](https://github.com/greenwoodgiant/UTAUS201801DATA2-Class-Repository-DATA/blob/master/Homework/04-Numpy-Pandas/HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli_Example.pdf) for
